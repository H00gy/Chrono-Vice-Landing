## What is Chrono-Vice?
Chrono-Vice is my upcoming 2D wristwatch dealing game centered around buying and selling watches while navigating a trend based simulated economic system. This Website demonstrate some gameplay prototypes for Chrono-Vice.

## Inventory System
The inventory system in "Chrono-Vice" will be game object based, showcased in this [prototype](https://github.com/H00gy/inventorySystem).
## Selection and Fake Identification
A core gameplay feature within "Chrono-Vice" is the identification of fake watches, "Chrono-Vice" already has a system for the game understanding which watches are fake and which aren't, this is a [prototype](https://github.com/H00gy/CheckBoxesAndBoxSelect) that showcases how the player selects those watches and how the game assigns "tags" to them based on player identification, regardless of their actual classification
## Customer NPC
In "Chrono-Vice" customer NPC's work off of 2 behaviors, buying and selling. This [prototype](https://github.com/H00gy/CustomerInteractionAndAI) showcases how those behaviors interact with the systems of "Chrono-Vice".
## Book system
This is a book [prototype](https://github.com/H00gy/Unity-2D-book/blob/main/README.md) that will be used as a reference book in "Chrono-Vice" so that the player can identify fake watches.
